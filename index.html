                	<b>1 - What a Web Page is?</b><br>
			                  A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>2 - How Coding Works</b><br>
			                  Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
			                  <br>I'm &lt;b&gt; learning &lt;/b&gt; to code!<br>
			                  look like this:<br>
			                  I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>3 - Computers are Stupid</b><br>
                  			Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").For example, if you forget to close a &lt;b&gt; tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <b>4- Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b><br>
                    			There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b><br>
                  			You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag, (&lt; /p&gt;). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag).
                    <li>Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
                    <li>Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write &lt;a href="www.udacity.com"&gt;

      <p>
        HTML structure is similar to that of a family tree. By that the code can branch out to braches that alos branch out or may just be a sigle branch.

          <p>
    	        As you read HTLM code you will notice bars on the left that reoresent boxes.  These boxes may then have boxes inside of boxes and you will see the lines that cover what is in that cover what is in that box.

          There are a few programs you can use to write code. The programs available will have a variety of features that could be useful in programing.  Some text editors will automatically generate closingHTML tags for the tag you created. For this course we will be using Scratpad, CodePen and Sublime2.

        CCS - Cascading Style Sheets
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The "C" is the most important part of the phrase. This styling will allow you to do an arrow of things from 
          changing color to changing size and spacing.
          You can use this to make formating and styling your page easier by using your setting for each time 
          you need something formated with these settings.  for example:
          <br><br>
          .description { atribute:style; } ex: .description { color:red;}
          <br><br>
          You can then use &lt;div class="description"&gt; for each time you want something with that style<br><br>
          Use CCS Style is setup to avoid repetition since you can set yo the exact look you want (Color, size, margins, effects, ect.)
          For a complete CCS reference click <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">here</a>.

            Sizing & Position
          </div>
          <div class="content">
          <p>
            <b>The Box Model:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Margin
              <li>Border- Content plus Padding inside
              <li>Padding- Space between border and content
              <li>Content- What you are displaying</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            There is a newer way to set up using { box-sizing:border-box } that includes both border and padding in one setting.
            (drawback, older browsers may not display).  In order to overcome any potential issues you will need to add the following:
            <br><br>
            {   -webkit-box-sizing:border-box;<br>
            -moz-box-sizing:border-box;<br>
            -ms-box-sizing:border-box;<br>
              box-sizing:border-box;}<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Size of a box can be done by either number of pixcels (does not change size based on screen)
            or percentage (based on size of screen)
            <br>
            Ex: &lt;div class="description" style="<br>
            Width:50%<br>
            Height:50%;"><br>
            This will make the width and hight be only 50% of the screen size.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Positioning</b> can be accomplished by adding display: flex; to the appropriate CCS will override the behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
